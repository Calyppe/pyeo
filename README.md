# pyeo
Python Earth Observation processing chain

This is designed to provide a set of portable, extensible and modular Python scripts for earth observation and machine learning.
This includes downloading, preprocessing, mosaicing and classification.

## Requirements
Package management is performed by Conda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
For downloading, you will need a Scihub account: https://scihub.copernicus.eu/
For Sentinel 2 processing, you will need Sen2Cor installed: http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor/
For AWS downloading, you will need credentials set up on your machine.

## To install

With Git installed, `cd` to an install location then run the following lines

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clcr/pyeo.git
cd pyeo
conda env create --file environment.yml --name pyeo
```

At present, Pyeo does not insert itself into your Python path. Instead, add the following lines to the start of your programs:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append("/path/to/pyeo/")
```

To verify the installation, open a Python prompt and type

```python
>>> import pyeo.core
```

You should get no errors.
