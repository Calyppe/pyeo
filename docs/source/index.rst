Introduction
############

Python For Earth Observation is a collection of functions for downloading, manipulating, combining and classifying
geospatial raster and vector data. It is intended to require a minimum of dependencies - most functions only require
the basic GDAL/OGR/OSR stack and Numpy.


Installation
############

With Git and Miniconda or Anaconda installed, :code:`cd` to an install location then run the following lines

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/clcr/pyeo.git
   cd pyeo
   conda env create --file environment.yml --name pyeo_env
   conda activate pyeo_env
   python -m pip install . -vv

In a Python prompt, try  :code:`import pyeo` - you should see no errors.

Quick start
###########
Before you start, you will need:

* A linux (or maybe mac, untested) machine
* A raster of your window area
* A shapefile of polygons over your training areas with a field containing class labels
* A raster to classify. This can be the same as your original raster.

  * All rasters and shapefiles should be in the same projection; ideally in the local projection of your satellite data.
* Git
* Anaconda/Miniconda


Use
***
To create a model

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate pyeo_env
   cd (whereever your data is)
   extract_signatures your_raster.tif your_shapefile.shp output.csv
   # You can now explore your signatures as a .csv file, and perform any interim processing
   create_model_from_signatures output.csv model.pkl
   classify_image your_raster model.pkl output_image.tif

Assumptions and design decisions
################################

Rasters
*******

When working with raster data (geotiff, .jp2, ect) using Pyeo, the folllowing assumtions have been made:

* Any function that reads a raster can read from any gdal-readable format
* All interim rasters are stored internally as a geotiff
* All internal rasters have a .tif extension in the filename
* Unless otherwise stated, **all rasters are assumed to be in a projected coordinate system** - i.e. in meters.
  Functions may fail if passed a raster in lat-long projection

Masks
*****
Some Pyeo functions include options for applying masks.

* A raster may have an associated mask

* A mask is a geotif with an identical name as the raster it's masking with a .msk extension

   * For example, the mask for my_sat_image.tif is my_sat_image.msk

* A mask is

   * a single band raster
   * of identical height, width and resolution of the related image
   * contains values 0 or 1

* A mask is applied by multiplying it with each band of its raster

   * So any pixel with a 0 in its mask will be removed, and a 1 will be kept

Timestamps
**********

* Pyeo uses the same timestamp convention as ESA: yyyymmddThhmmss

   * For example, 1PM on 27th December 2020 would be 20201227T130000
* All timestamps are in UTC

Models
******

* All models are serialised and deserialised using joblib.dump or joblib.load


A small test suite is located in pyeo/tests/pyeo_tests.py; this is designed for use with py.test.
Some example applications and demos are in pyeo/apps; for an illustration of the use of the library,
pyeo/apps/change_detection/simple_s2_change_detection.py is recommended.
